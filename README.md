Social Media login benefits: There are several advantages when using established social
media providers for a websites login features. Firstly, it is easier for the user as they
most likely already have an account for facebook or google and therefore will not require
a separate account to use your website. Secondly, it is much easier to develop and maintain
as you site does not need to include much code for the login functionality or in terms
of a database. Finally, it is much more secure as it can be assumed that large organisations
such as google and facebook will be able to provide a much more secure system then you could
provide. These organisations typically have several security features associated with their
accounts such as two factor authentication which could be time consuming and costly to implement
yourself.


Angular WebApi: Using angular in combination with a webapi allows for content rich single page 
applications to be created with relative ease. ASP.net core api allows for a CRUD api to be 
constructed quickly allowing for more focus to be placed on the front end development. Angular 
ensures that developing the front end is easily achievable no matter how complicated your 
application. Angular's data binding functionality allows for api requests to be mapped directly
to dom elements, greatly reducing the time commitment and complexity of connecting a webapi to
the front end.
