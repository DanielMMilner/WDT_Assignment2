Social Media login benifits: There are several advantages when using established social
media providors for a websites login fetures. Firstly, it is easier for the user as they
mosy likely already have an account for facebook or google and therefore will not require
a seperate account to use your website. Secondly, it is much easier to develop and maintain
as you site does not need to include much code for the login functionallity or in terms
of a database. Finally, it is much more secure as it can be assumed that large organisations
such as google and facebook will be able to provide a much more secure system then you could
provide. These organisations typically have several security features associated with their
accounts such as two factor authentication which could be time consuming and costly to implement
yourself.
